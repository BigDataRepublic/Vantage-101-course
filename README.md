# Welcome to the Vantage 101 course repository!

If you came here through a link on the Vantage 101 website, great! If not, please check out the course accompanying this repository [at the Vantage 101 website](https://www.vantage-ai.com/vantage101).

This course repository is set up such that each branch contains the solutions for the chapters until then. That is, branch `chapter-1-case-introduction` will contain our codebase after completing chapter 1, and `chapter-4-clean-code` will contain the codebase after completing chapters 1-4, etc. You may consider these as an example solution, however there is no single correct way to complete the assignments in the Vantage 101. So do not feel discouraged if your solution is not exactly like ours, as long as you applied the principles that were explained in the chapter you probably did just fine!

If you would like one of our Vantage consultants to take a look at your solution and provide you with feedback, feel free to get in touch with us through the contact form on the [Vantage 101 website](https://www.vantage-ai.com/vantage101)!

PS: It is possible that at the time you are reading this not all chapters have a solution available here. If that is the case, please check again later as we're probably busy creating it or send us a message though the contact form [on our website](https://www.vantage-ai.com/vantage101) and we will provide you with feedback on your solution!
