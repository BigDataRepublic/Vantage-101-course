# Welcome to the Vantage 101

## What is this?

Vantage 101 is the ultimate course a Machine Learning Engineer wishes they had done at the beginning of their career. Originally, 'Vantage 101' was an internal guide to onboard new employees and get them up-to-date with current ML engineering best practices. Over time our guidebook became so popular that we decided to give back to the community and make it available to the public.

It is a pragmatic course focused on learning the best practices of Machine Learning Engineering through coding examples. These are topics that you won't find in a university course or data science book. Tools, techniques, methods and best practices, all are covered in this dense hands-on guide. From setting up your IDE all the way to deploying containers in the cloud. The content in this course is up-to-date with what our consultants come across at their clients, which means that you get a unique insight into the industry's preferred methods and tools.

## Who is this for?

The Vantage 101 is intended for anyone who wants to either get into ML engineering, or refresh and update their skills with industry best practices. You can also use this course as a reference, for whenever you encounter an ML engineering issue in the future. 

We assume that the average reader will have completed a data science/statistics/mathematics education and would be able to build a model in a Jupyter Notebook. In this course we look at everything that has to happen to go from Notebook to end product.

## How does it work?

The aim is to have a concise, but very complete, hands-on guide for different experience levels. 

Every chapter will cover some part of a Machine Learning Engineering topic in theory, with plenty of links to external sources, courses and tools. At the end of the chapter you will also apply the methods covered to the example case. Of course, you can implement your learnings directly to your own case as well.

You can find all of this code in the ```code``` folder. This also makes it easy to quickly review topics that you already have some experience with. Each topic also contains a curated list of links to useful resources that go in-depth on the subject matter.

We recommend you start with chapter ```1. Case Introduction```, and work your way through the rest of the course.

## What's the case?

We believe that dry theory is not enough to fully grasp a concept, which is why we also use an example case to apply all our methods on. Throughout the course we will be using the Australian rainfall case. We will use the dataset and a basic notebook with a model to start off our course. The code and data for this case can be found in the ```code``` folder, and you will see plenty of code snippets throughout the chapters as well.
